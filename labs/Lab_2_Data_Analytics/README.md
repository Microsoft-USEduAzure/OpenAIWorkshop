# DATA ANALYTICS

## Objective

In this lab you will learn how to use Azure OpenAI to query SQL data using natural language query.

This application also demonstrates the use of Azure Open AI to help answer business questions by performing advanced data analytic tasks on a enterprise database.

Examples of questions are:

- Simple: Show me daily revenue trends in 2016  per region
- More difficult: Is that true that top 20% customers generate 80% revenue in 2016?
- Advanced: Forecast monthly revenue for next 12 months starting from June-2018

The application supports Python's built-in SQLITE (*recommended* for lab) as well as your own Microsoft SQL Server.

## Summary

You will need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run this lab in your local computer and then deploy it to Azure.

You can use an existing SQL database or the default database provided in the lab.

## Appplication Overview

There are two applications:

- **SQL Query Writing Assistant**: a simple application that translate business question into SQL query language then execute and display result.
- **Data Analysis Assistant**: a more sophisticated application to perform advanced data analytics such as statisical analysis and forecasting. Here we demonstrate the use of [Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) and [React](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) techniques to perform multi-step processing where the next step in the chain also depends on the observation/result from the previous step.

### First Appication: Use SQL Query Writing Assistant

![](../../documents/media/da_assistant2.png)

- Use a question from the FAQ or enter your own question.
- You can select ```show code``` and/or ```show prompt``` to show SQL query and the prompt behind the scene.
- Click on submit to execute and see result.

### Second Application: Use Data Ananalyst Assistant

![](../../documents/media/da_assistant3.png) 

- Use a question from the FAQ or enter your own question.
- You can select ```show code``` and/or ```show prompt``` to show SQL & Python code and  the prompt behind the scene.
- Click on submit to execute and see result.
- For advanced questions such as forecasting, you can use GPT-4 as the engine

## Step 1. Clone this repository

Open VS Code and Clone this repository:

![](../../documents/images/lab-3-data-2.png)

the URL is: https://github.com/Microsoft-USEduAzure/OpenAIWorkshop.git

from the terminal, navigate to ```cd labs/Lab_2_Data_Analytics```

## Step 2. Set up enviromental variables

 Provide settings for Open AI and Database.You can either create a file named `secrets.env` file in the root of this folder (labs/lab_2_data_analytics) as below or do it using the app's UI later on.

    - Option 1: use built-in SQLITE (recommended). Then you don't need to install SQL Server.
        ```txt
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="9999999999999999999999999"
        AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_GPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_CHATGPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://openairesourcename.openai.azure.com/
        SQL_ENGINE = "sqlite"
        ```
    - Option 2: use your own SQL Server
        ```txt
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="9999999999999999999999999"
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://openairesourcename.openai.azure.com/"
        AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_GPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT="NAME_OF_CHATGPT_4_DEPLOYMENT"
        SQL_USER="sqluserid"
        SQL_PASSWORD="sqlpassword"
        SQL_DATABASE="WideWorldImportersDW"
        SQL_SERVER="sqlservername.database.windows.net"
     
        ```

> **IMPORTANT** If you are a Mac user, please follow [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos?view=sql-server-ver16) to install ODBC for PYODBC

## Step 3. Configure development environment

> **NOTE** all activities in this step will performed using the command line in VS Code terminal

### Step 3.1 navigate to the root directory of this lab

Navigate to ```cd labs/Lab_2_Data_Analytics```

### Step 3.2 Create a python environment with version from 3.7 and 3.10

This step is required **ONLY If did not perform this during pre-requisites**

    - [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
        - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`. 

### Step 3.3  Import the requirements.txt

run the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 3.4 run the application locally

To run the application from the command line: `streamlit run app.py`

You will see the application load in your browser

## Deploy the application to Azure (optional)

This application can be deployed to an Azure subscription using the Azure Developer CLI.
There is no need to have any coding experience to deploy this application but you will need permissions to create resources in an Azure Subscription

> **Note** All steps will be performed in VS Code Terminal

The following steps are to require to deploy to Azure:

### Step 1. Install Azure Developer CLS

> **Note** This step is required only if you did not installed this as part of pre-requisites Install 

Download and install [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)

### Step 2. Navigate top the root directory of the OpenAIWorkshop

   Go to the local directory of the OpenAIWorkshop

### Step 3. Authenticate to Azure

run the command `azd auth login` and follow instructions

### Step 4. Create a local environment

run the command `azd env new` and follow the prompts

    > ðŸ’¡ NOTE: If deploying to the same Subscription as others, use a unique name

### Step 5. Deploy app and infrastructure

run the command `azd up`

### Step 6. Configure settings

Once the deployment is completed, click on the URL listed  to open the application

Click on settings. Provide Open AI keys, deployment name and URL for ChatGPT. Optionally, you can provide deployment name for GPT-4 for advanced questions.

For data, you can use the built-in SQLITE demo dataset or you can choose to specify your own SQL Server. In case you use SQLITE, you don't need to enter details for SQL Server.

Click on submit to save settings.
